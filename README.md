# NailsBookingApp-API-Public
Public version of my Nails Booking API

## To do very soon:
- Complete code architecture refactor with CQRS and MediatR pattern
- Make code loosely coupled. For test purposes evrtything is now tightly coupled in controllers.
- Refactor ApiResponse - This class is repeated almost in every request. This class is not necessary because im going to base on status codes and middlewares to handle api response.
